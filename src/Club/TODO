use validators in coupon
bind coupon to specific product
move all login pages to /user
not 2 schedules can have the same interval
what will happen if interval access multiple days
dynamic number of partners for a booking
booking module should work without partners too
much better debugging on errors from API.. make sure all errors is wrapped in encode->encodeError()
what happens if you put schema on already booked interval
booking admins should be able to deleted planned schedules too
something is broken when creating more intervals on the same field, fix it
on admin interval manager, put a default interval in top, that will set the same for everyone
when field created, forward to create interval page
on switch location, stay on last visited page
