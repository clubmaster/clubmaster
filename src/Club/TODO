users and admin should be able to delete booking
scroll right and left on booking page
login directly through booking
add booking confirmation
make login form visible in the left when not logged in
better booking schema:
  - add tooltips
better pick opponent form
jquery form on booking

== NOTES TO LATER ==
implement payment for booking
make more simple demo location setup
change time comparence to object compare instead of timestamp
use validators in coupon
bind coupon to specific product
fix num_team_day
fint a smart way to get default location, might be with the url
add booking plans
  - maintenance
  - cleaning
  - tournament
login through team attend page
login through booking page
move all login pages to /user
not 2 schedules can have the same interval
what will happen if interval access multiple days
