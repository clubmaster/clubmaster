give better debug information on team attend error
add if user is attending team on /api/users/teams
add name for instructor on /api/teams/
support for both bookings and schedules on booking schema

== NOTES TO LATER ==
login through booking page
jquery overlay form on booking
implement payment for booking
change time comparence to object compare instead of timestamp
use validators in coupon
bind coupon to specific product
fix num_team_day
find a smart way to get default location, might be with the url
add booking plans
  - maintenance
  - cleaning
  - tournament
login through team attend page
move all login pages to /user
not 2 schedules can have the same interval
what will happen if interval access multiple days
dynamic number of partners for a booking
booking module should work without partners too
add display username
add address on club to api
remove API KEY from BookingBundle/Resources/views/Overview/view.html.twig
much better debugging on errors from API.. make sure all errors is wrapped in encode->encodeError()
