== NOTES FOR THIS RELEASE ==
problem with stopped subscription on auto_renewal
test booking in:
  opera,
  ie 9
  ie 8,
  ie 7
open and close booking on specific dates for fields
add booking plans
  - maintenance
  - cleaning
  - tournament
fix num_team_day
rules for when on the day a subscription can use booking
something is broken when creating more intervals on the same field, fix it
when field created, forward to create interval page

== NOTES TO LATER ==
what happens if you put schema on already booked interval
booking admins should be able to deleted planned schedules too
on admin interval manager, put a default interval in top, that will set the same for everyone
implement payment for booking
gravatar throw warning if gravatar does not work (missing network)
find a way for family subscription
price on event, has to be optional to use the club system, or pay on arrival
find a better way with installer, the file is pretty old school
change all equal form.html.twig to layout default
enable and disable teams
enable and disable bookings
enable and disable events
make sure either create or updated always comes first
make sure widgets works:
  - datetime
  - date
  - time
login through booking page
login through team attend page
jquery overlay form on booking
make sure that not 2 intervals can be valid at the same time
find a smart way to get default location, might be with the url
use validators in coupon
bind coupon to specific product
move all login pages to /user
not 2 schedules can have the same interval
what will happen if interval access multiple days
dynamic number of partners for a booking, from 0 to 888
much better debugging on errors from API.. make sure all errors is wrapped in encode->encodeError()
on switch location, stay on last visited page
simplify new_subscription_listener shop
