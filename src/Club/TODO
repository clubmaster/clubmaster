users and admin should be able to delete booking
login through booking page
scroll right and left on booking page
add booking confirmation
better booking schema:
  - add tooltips
jquery autocomplete partner form
jquery overlay form on booking
support for both bookings and schedules on booking schema

== NOTES TO LATER ==
implement payment for booking
make more simple demo location setup
change time comparence to object compare instead of timestamp
use validators in coupon
bind coupon to specific product
fix num_team_day
fint a smart way to get default location, might be with the url
add booking plans
  - maintenance
  - cleaning
  - tournament
login through team attend page
move all login pages to /user
not 2 schedules can have the same interval
what will happen if interval access multiple days
dynamic number of partners for a booking
